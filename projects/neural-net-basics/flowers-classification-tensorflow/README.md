# Intro to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project

## Synopsis

This project focuses on building an image classifier using TensorFlow and converting it into a command-line application. The classifier is trained to recognize 102 different types of flowers using a dataset containing approximately 20 images per flower. After training, the classifier is tested on new images to predict the correct flower type.

The project demonstrates essential machine learning techniques, including neural network training with TensorFlow, handling large datasets, and deploying machine learning models in practical applications.

## Key Highlights

- **Image Classification**: Train a neural network to classify images of flowers into 102 categories.
- **TensorFlow Implementation**: Utilize TensorFlow to design, train, and evaluate the model.
- **Deployment**: Convert the trained model into a functional command-line application.
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Work with a substantial dataset in a GPU-enabled environment for efficient training and performance.

This project highlights the practical applications of machine learning in image recognition tasks and showcases the integration of model training with real-world usability.
