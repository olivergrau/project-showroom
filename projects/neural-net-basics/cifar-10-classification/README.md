# Image Classifier and Object Detection System using PyTorch

## Synopsis

This project involves building an image classifier and object detection system using PyTorch, with a focus on solving a real-world problem for a self-driving car startup. The goal is to classify objects using the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate the performance of the in-house solution against a commercially available algorithm from Detectocorp, which claims 70% accuracy on CIFAR-10.

The project demonstrates core deep learning techniques, including data augmentation, neural network design, and transfer learning, to develop a robust image classifier. It also includes a comparative analysis of the classifier's accuracy against both the Detectocorp solution and state-of-the-art results in the field.

## Scenario

As a machine learning engineer at a self-driving car startup, your task is to determine whether to build an in-house object detection solution or purchase one from Detectocorp. By leveraging the CIFAR-10 dataset, you will:

1. Build and train an image classifier using PyTorch.
2. Evaluate its accuracy and compare it with the Detectocorp solution (70% accuracy).
3. Benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art models, such as GPipe, which achieved 99% accuracy.
4. Make a recommendation to management on whether to build or buy the solution.

## CIFAR-10

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark in computer vision research, featuring 60,000 labeled images across 10 classes. It has driven significant innovation in neural network design, with the current state-of-the-art accuracy achieved by GPipe at 99%. While GPipe is a massive model with 557 million parameters, this project allows for experimentation with more streamlined architectures suitable for practical use.
