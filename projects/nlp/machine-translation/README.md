# Machine Translation with Deep Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep neural network as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The pipeline takes English text as input and returns its French translation. The project demonstrates key concepts in natural language processing (NLP) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling using deep learning techniques.

## Key Components

1. **Deep Neural Network for Translation**:
   - Develop and train a neural network to handle sequence-to-sequence translation tasks.
   - Use embeddings and recurrent architectures for effective representation and processing of text data.

2. **End-to-End Pipeline**:
   - Integrate preprocessing, model training, and inference into a seamless pipeline for machine translation.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Validate the performance of the translation model against predefined metrics.
