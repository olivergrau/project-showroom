# Hidden Markov Model for Part-of-Speech Tagging

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging using the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library. The model leverages a universal tagset and demonstrates how probabilistic models can effectively analyze and predict linguistic structures. Hidden Markov Models are widely used in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, bioinformatics, and computer vision, making this project a versatile example of HMM applications.

## Key Features

1. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**:
   - Implement a Hidden Markov Model to tag words in text with their respective parts of speech.
   - Achieve high tag accuracy using probabilistic modeling techniques.

2. **Broad Applicability**:
   - Demonstrates how HMMs are used beyond NLP, such as in speech recognition, machine translation, and gesture recognition.

3. **Interactive Implementation**:
   - Complete a series of guided coding tasks within a Jupyter Notebook.
   - Understand key HMM concepts, including transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and the Viterbi algorithm.

## How It Works

The project is structured to guide you through the construction of an HMM for POS tagging:
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Prepare text data with a universal tagset for training and testing.
- **HMM Construction**: Define transition and emission probabilities, and implement the Viterbi algorithm for decoding sequences.
- **Evaluation**: Test the model on provided datasets and assess its accuracy and performance.
