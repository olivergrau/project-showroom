    "The `retrieve_game` tool is a semantic search function that queries a vector database for video game information based on a user's input. It uses the ChromaDB collection to find the most relevant results matching the query, leveraging embeddings for similarity search. The function returns a list of dictionaries, each containing key details about a game (name, platform, release year, description). This tool enables the agent to answer questions using structured, contextually relevant data from the internal database, making it suitable for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows."

    "#### Evaluate Retrieval Tool\n",
    "The `evaluate_retrieval` tool is designed to assess the usefulness of documents retrieved from the vector database in answering a user's question. It leverages the `AgentEvaluator` class, which provides automated evaluation capabilities using an LLM. The tool parses the retrieved documents, formats them for clarity, and creates a test case describing the user's query and the expected outcome. The `AgentEvaluator` then analyzes the agent's response (the retrieved documents) and generates feedback on whether the information is sufficient and relevant. This process ensures that the agent only relies on internal knowledge when it is adequate, and can trigger a web search if the evaluation finds gaps. The use of `AgentEvaluator` enables objective, consistent, and scalable evaluation of retrieval quality within the agent workflow."
