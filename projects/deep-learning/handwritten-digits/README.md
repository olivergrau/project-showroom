# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Handwritten Digits

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using deep learning techniques. As a proof of concept, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is used to prototype a model capable of recognizing handwritten characters. This work lays the groundwork for a larger OCR system and showcases the potential of neural networks in solving computer vision tasks.
