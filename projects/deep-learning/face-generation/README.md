# GANs Project: Face Generation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic human face images. By leveraging deep learning, you will build a model that learns to synthesize high-quality images through the interplay between a generator and a discriminator. The project highlights key concepts in data preprocessing, model design, and iterative training, demonstrating the power of GANs in image generation tasks.

## Key Components

1. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Implement data augmentation techniques and create a custom dataset class to preprocess and load face images effectively.
   - Transform the dataset to optimize it for training the GAN.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Design a custom generator model to create realistic face images.
   - Build a custom discriminator model to distinguish between real and generated images.

3. **Loss Functions and Optimization**:
   - Choose appropriate loss functions for the generator and discriminator.
   - Decide whether to incorporate advanced techniques like gradient penalty to stabilize training.

4. **Training Process**:
   - Develop a training loop for the GAN, ensuring a balanced optimization process between the generator and discriminator.
   - Experiment with training strategies to improve the quality of generated images iteratively.
