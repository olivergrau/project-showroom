# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Landmark Recognition and Location Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-powered application capable of predicting the most likely locations of user-supplied images based on landmarks depicted in them. The project demonstrates how to construct a processing pipeline that incorporates deep learning models to handle real-world, unstructured data and solve practical problems.

By the end of this project, you will have developed an application that takes an image as input and suggests the top-k most relevant landmarks from a set of 50 possible landmarks worldwide. This project highlights the challenges of piecing together various models in a real-world application and addresses the complexities of working with diverse data sources.

## Key Features

1. **Landmark Recognition and Location Prediction**:
   - Identify and classify landmarks depicted in user-supplied images.
   - Predict the most likely locations associated with the landmarks.

2. **Deep Learning with CNNs**:
   - Build a CNN from scratch to understand the fundamentals of image recognition.
   - Use transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for improved performance and efficiency.

3. **End-to-End Application**:
   - Develop an app that integrates the trained model to accept user images and produce predictions in a user-friendly format.

## Real-World Relevance

Photo-sharing platforms often lack location metadata for uploaded images, either because the capturing device lacks GPS functionality or metadata is removed for privacy reasons. Automatically inferring the location of an image using discernible landmarks solves this issue, enabling features like:

- **Automatic Tagging**: Suggest relevant tags based on landmarks in the image.
- **Photo Organization**: Group photos by location to enhance user experience.

This project tackles these challenges by providing an automated and scalable solution using CNNs.

## Dataset

The project uses a subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2, a comprehensive collection of landmark images from around the world.
