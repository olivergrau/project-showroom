In practice, doing “one batch per iteration” is not exactly the same as the original paper’s pseudocode—which loops over full episodes and then does updates—but it’s still valid. Here’s why:

1. **The Original Paper**  
   - The pseudocode suggests a more “episode-based” loop: collect a full episode of experience, then do learning steps (often either after each step or at the end of the episode).
   - Because DDPG is off-policy, it’s flexible in how you gather experience and how often you update. The paper’s pseudocode is just one structured way to do it.

2. **Your Worker-Based Setup**  
   - You continuously collect experience in the environment worker(s) and store it in the replay buffer.
   - In the training loop, you sample one batch per iteration and perform one training step each time.
   - Over time, you’re still training on off-policy data, so conceptually it aligns with DDPG’s fundamentals.  

3. **Possible Differences**  
   - **Number of Updates per Environment Step**: In your approach, you might do exactly one gradient update for each time you sample a batch. In the original approach, you might do multiple gradient steps per episode or per environment step.  
   - **Data Distribution**: Because your environment worker runs continuously, you’re sampling from a potentially more diverse, asynchronous set of transitions. This is typically fine for an off-policy method like DDPG, but it can differ from the paper’s strictly episode-based transitions.

4. **Could It Cause Problems?**  
   - **Not inherently**. Many modern RL libraries (e.g., Stable Baselines, RLlib) do exactly this kind of continuous data collection and periodic sampling for updates.  
   - **Tuning**: You may need to adjust hyperparameters—like how many environment steps you collect before starting training, how many updates you do per environment step, or how large your replay buffer is—to stabilize learning.  
   - **Ensuring Enough Data**: Make sure you’re not training too soon with too few transitions or continuing to train with outdated data distribution. (But again, that’s a hyperparameter choice rather than a fundamental flaw.)

### **Summary**

- Doing a single training step per sampled batch in your asynchronous setup is still a valid off-policy method for DDPG.  
- It’s just a different loop structure than the paper’s per-episode pseudocode.  
- It typically does **not** cause fundamental problems—many RL frameworks follow a similar design—but it does mean you need to watch out for hyperparameter tuning and data-collection ratios.

Below is an example of how you might rewrite the original pseudocode for DDPG (as seen in the DeepMind paper) into pseudocode that reflects your worker‐based implementation. This side‐by‐side comparison can help highlight the differences.

### **Original DDPG Pseudocode (Simplified)**

```plaintext
Initialize critic network Q and actor network μ with random weights.
Initialize target networks Q′ and μ′ with weights Q and μ.
Initialize replay buffer R.

for episode = 1 to M do:
    s₁ ← initial state from environment
    for t = 1 to T do:
        aₜ ← μ(sₜ) + exploration noise
        Execute action aₜ, observe reward rₜ and next state sₜ₊₁
        Store transition (sₜ, aₜ, rₜ, sₜ₊₁) in R
        Sample random minibatch of N transitions from R
        Update critic Q by minimizing:
            L = 1/N ∑ (r + γ·Q′(sₜ₊₁, μ′(sₜ₊₁)) - Q(sₜ, aₜ))²
        Update actor μ using the sampled policy gradient
        Soft update target networks:
            Q′ ← τ·Q + (1-τ)·Q′,   μ′ ← τ·μ + (1-τ)·μ′
        sₜ ← sₜ₊₁
    end for
end for
```

> **Note:** Here, **M** is a predetermined maximum number of episodes, and updates are performed after each environment step (or at the end of each episode).

### **Worker-Based DDPG Implementation (Adapted Pseudocode)**

```plaintext
# Global Initialization:
Initialize replay buffer R.
Initialize actor network μ and critic network Q with random weights.
Initialize target networks μ′ ← μ and Q′ ← Q.

Launch Environment Worker Process:
    Loop forever:
        s ← initial state from environment (raw observation)
        Normalize s (if using normalization)
        while episode not done:
            a ← μ(s) + exploration noise
            Execute action a in environment
            Observe reward r and new state s′
            Normalize s′ (using same normalization parameters)
            Store transition (s, a, r, s′) in replay buffer R
            s ← s′

Launch Evaluation Worker Process:
    Loop forever:
        Wait for updated weights from training (or periodically pull weights)
        Every fixed interval:
            Run one or more evaluation episodes with policy μ (no noise)
            For each episode:
                s ← initial state from environment, normalized as above
                while episode not done:
                    a ← μ(s)   # No exploration noise
                    Execute action a, observe r and s′
                    Normalize s′
                    Accumulate reward
                    s ← s′
            Compute average reward over recent evaluation episodes.
            If average reward ≥ desired threshold:
                Signal "solved" (e.g., send a message to training process)

Launch Training Worker Process:
    Loop until stop signal is received:
        Sample a minibatch of transitions from replay buffer R.
        Perform one training update:
            Update critic Q by minimizing:
                L = 1/N ∑ (r + γ·Q′(s′, μ′(s′)) - Q(s, a))²
            Update actor μ using the policy gradient.
            Soft update target networks:
                μ′ ← τ·μ + (1-τ)·μ′,   Q′ ← τ·Q + (1-τ)·Q′
        Every fixed number of iterations (or steps):
            Send updated weights to the environment and evaluation workers.
```

### **Key Differences Explained:**

- **Episode vs. Iteration:**
  - **Original Pseudocode:**  
    The algorithm loops explicitly over episodes. Each episode collects transitions, and then training is performed (often after each step or episode).
  - **Worker-Based Implementation:**  
    The environment worker continuously interacts with the environment and writes transitions into the replay buffer without explicit “episode” boundaries in the training loop.  
    The training worker independently samples batches and performs gradient updates (each update is an "iteration") which are not tied one-to-one to environment episodes.

- **Data Collection and Updates:**
  - **Original:**  
    The loop structure clearly separates data collection (an episode) and training updates.
  - **Worker-Based:**  
    Data collection (in the env_worker) and training (in the train_worker) run concurrently. This asynchronous design is common in modern RL systems.

- **Evaluation and Termination:**
  - **Original:**  
    There is no explicit evaluation loop; the pseudocode simply runs for M episodes.
  - **Worker-Based:**  
    A separate eval_worker periodically runs evaluation episodes (without exploration noise) and signals when the training goal is reached, allowing early stopping.

- **Normalization (if applied):**
  - In your worker-based setup, normalization is applied in the env_worker. This ensures that all transitions stored in the replay buffer are preprocessed consistently. The same normalization must be applied during evaluation and training.

---

### **Implications:**

- In your implementation, each training iteration corresponds to a single gradient update on a minibatch, whereas the original pseudocode implies updates are performed within each episode. This difference is mainly architectural—since DDPG is an off-policy method, continuous asynchronous updates are perfectly valid.
- Your design decouples environment interaction, training, and evaluation into separate processes. This can improve efficiency and responsiveness, but it also means you need to carefully manage synchronization (e.g., weight updates) between components.
- Provided that the normalization (if used) and replay buffer dynamics are consistent, your worker-based design is equivalent in terms of learning the control policy, even though the structure (episodes vs. continuous iterations) appears different.
