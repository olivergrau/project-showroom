    "## **1️⃣ Use Replay Buffer in Its Own Process**\n",
    "### ✅ Justification:\n",
    "- **Avoids race conditions** when both the training and data collection processes interact with the buffer.\n",
    "- **Prevents memory contention** by isolating replay storage operations from CPU/GPU workloads.\n",
    "- **Decouples storage from compute-intensive tasks**, making data access smoother.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2️⃣ Replay Buffer as the Bridge Between Training and Data Collection**\n",
    "### ✅ Justification:\n",
    "- **Producer-Consumer Model**: The **data collection process (Unity environment)** produces experience data, while the **training process** consumes it for learning.\n",
    "- **Ensures non-blocking behavior**: Training can proceed independently while new data is collected.\n",
    "- **Avoids excessive synchronization overhead**, allowing each process to run at its own pace.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3️⃣ Three Separate Processes for Efficiency**\n",
    "### ✅ Justification:\n",
    "1. **Replay Buffer Process**:\n",
    "   - Manages stored experience and handles sampling/insertion requests efficiently.\n",
    "   - Runs in a **dedicated process** to prevent contention with the training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Process**:\n",
    "   - Fetches batches from the replay buffer asynchronously and updates the TD3 neural networks.\n",
    "   - Utilizes the **GPU fully without waiting** for new experience data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Collection Process (Unity Environment)**:\n",
    "   - Steps the environment in parallel for **20 agents**, collecting `(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` tuples.\n",
    "   - Pushes data to the replay buffer **without blocking training**.\n",
    "   - Offloads simulation work to the **CPU**, allowing for efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🌟 Summary**\n",
    "- **Replay Buffer runs independently** to mediate between training and data collection.\n",
    "- **Training and data collection processes operate in parallel**, preventing bottlenecks.\n",
    "- **Each process is optimized for its specific task**, ensuring full utilization of CPU & GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture balances **parallelism, efficiency, and stability**, leading to **faster training times** while keeping the system modular and scalable.\n",
