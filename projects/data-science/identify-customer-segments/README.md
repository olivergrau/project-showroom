# Identify Customer Segments

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing demographic data to identify customer segments for a mail-order sales company in Germany. By exploring and preprocessing data, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, and performing clustering, the project uncovers patterns that differentiate the companyâ€™s customers from the general population. These insights can help businesses better understand their target market and optimize marketing strategies.

The project involves working with proprietary demographic datasets, applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering, and interpreting results to provide actionable business insights.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing or unknown values, and determine which features to retain or re-encode.
- Develop a cleaning procedure to handle missing data, remove irrelevant features, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

### 2. Feature Transformation
- Apply feature scaling to ensure that all features are on a comparable scale for subsequent analysis.
- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by identifying principal components that capture the most variability in the data.
- Interpret the components and determine the optimal number to retain for clustering.

### 3. Clustering
- Perform k-means clustering on the transformed demographic data to group individuals into distinct segments.
- Apply the same clustering model to the customer dataset to identify how customer segments differ from the general population.
- Analyze the distribution of clusters to determine which demographic groups are likely to be customers of the mail-order sales company.
