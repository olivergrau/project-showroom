# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, and understanding this behavior is critical for improving retention and minimizing losses. By analyzing customer data, the project identifies key factors contributing to churn and develops predictive models to forecast which customers are at risk of leaving.

The project leverages data science methodologies, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability, to provide actionable insights for businesses to improve customer retention strategies.
