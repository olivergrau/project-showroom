# Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to identify potential donors for CharityML, a fictitious nonprofit organization. The goal is to predict individuals likely to donate based on their demographic and financial information. Using the modified census dataset, the project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and optimization.

The project highlights the importance of using machine learning to make data-driven decisions, improving efficiency in identifying and targeting potential donors.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: 
  - A modified version of the UCI census dataset containing approximately 32,000 data points and 13 features.
  - Includes demographic and financial details such as age, education level, occupation, and income.
  - Target variable: `income` (<=50K or >50K).

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
  - Understand feature distributions and their relationships to donor likelihood.

- **Model Development**:
  - Train and evaluate supervised learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to predict donor behavior.
  - Compare model performance based on metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Preprocess categorical and numerical data for optimal model performance.

- **Insights and Recommendations**:
  - Identify key features that influence donor behavior, such as education, hours worked per week, and capital gains.
