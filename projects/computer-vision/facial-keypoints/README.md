# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a system to detect facial keypoints using a combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning. Facial keypoints include features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, which are critical for applications like facial tracking, pose recognition, emotion detection, and facial filters.

The system takes an image as input, detects faces, and predicts the locations of keypoints on each detected face. The project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for keypoint detection and integrating it with a face detection algorithm to process images effectively.

## Key Components

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and visualize the facial keypoint dataset, which consists of images labeled with keypoint coordinates.
2. **Model Development**: Define and train a CNN to predict facial keypoints accurately.
3. **Face Detection Integration**: Use Haar cascades to detect faces in an image, preprocess the detected regions, and apply the trained CNN to predict keypoints.
4. **Visualization and Analysis**: Visualize the predicted keypoints overlaid on the input images and analyze the model's performance.

## Applications Demonstrated

- **Facial Feature Detection**: Detect key facial features with a trained CNN.
- **Integration with Detection Algorithms**: Combine face detection (using Haar cascades) with a deep learning model for end-to-end functionality.
- **Visualization of Learned Features**: Explore the internal workings of the CNN by visualizing learned convolutional filters and feature maps.

This project showcases the intersection of computer vision and deep learning techniques in addressing real-world problems like facial recognition and emotion detection.
