    "## Project Overview: Building a Basic Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Recommendation System?\n",
    "A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that predicts a user's preferences and suggests items (e.g., movies, songs, products) that the user is likely to find relevant. It is widely used in industries such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media to enhance user experience and engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of a Recommendation System\n",
    "The primary goal of a recommendation system is to:\n",
    "- Personalize user experiences by suggesting items tailored to individual tastes.\n",
    "- Handle large volumes of data efficiently to present the most relevant content.\n",
    "- Improve user retention and satisfaction by helping users discover new content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- **Spotify** recommends songs based on your listening history.\n",
    "- **Netflix** suggests movies and TV shows based on your viewing habits.\n",
    "- **Amazon** recommends products based on your previous purchases and browsing history.\n",

    "### Goals of This Project\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a simplified recommendation system while learning the key concepts and techniques used in real-world implementations. By the end of this project, we will have implemented a recommendation system capable of:\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering**:\n",
    "   - Predicting user preferences based on similar users or items.\n",
    "2. **Content-Based Filtering**:\n",
    "   - Recommending items by analyzing item features.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Approach**:\n",
    "   - Combining collaborative and content-based methods for improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods to be Implemented\n",
    "We will explore and implement the following methods step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "- **User-Based Filtering**: Recommends items to a user based on the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "- Implements a matrix factorization approach using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "- Leverages item features (e.g., genres, descriptions) to recommend items similar to those the user likes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Neural Network-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "- Implements a matrix factorization approach (static embeddings) using deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Neural Network-Based Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "- Uses PyTorch to create create Content-Based Recommendation Net.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Hybrid Approach (Optional Extension)\n",
    "- Combines collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Roadmap\n",
    "1. Define the Goal (This Step).\n",
    "2. Explore and Preprocess the the MovieLens Dataset.\n",
    "3. Implement a Baseline Model.\n",
    "4. Develop Collaborative Filtering Models.\n",
    "5. Implement Neural Network-Based Models.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the System.\n",
    "7. Experiment with Advanced Enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome\n",
    "By completing this project, we will:\n",
    "- Understand the underlying principles of recommendation systems.\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience with Python and PyTorch for building ML models.\n",
    "- Build a fully functional, albeit simplified, recommendation system that can serve as a foundation for more advanced projects.\n"
