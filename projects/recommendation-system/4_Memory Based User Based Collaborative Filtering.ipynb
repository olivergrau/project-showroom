    "## Introduction: Memory-Based User-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement a **memory-based User-Based Collaborative Filtering (CF)** approach to build a simple recommendation system. Collaborative Filtering is a widely used method for personalized recommendations, relying on the principle that **users with similar preferences in the past will have similar preferences in the future**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- **User Similarity**: The system identifies users with similar interaction patterns using a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity).\n",
    "- **Neighbors and Aggregation**: Recommendations are generated by aggregating preferences from a target user's most similar neighbors.\n",
    "- **No Training**: Unlike modern machine learning-based approaches, memory-based CF does not involve explicit training. Instead, it directly uses observed user-item interactions to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Memory-Based User-Based CF\n",
    "1. **Scalability**: \n",
    "   - Computing user-user similarities becomes computationally expensive as the number of users grows.\n",
    "   - This limits its use in large-scale systems.\n",
    "2. **Sparsity**:\n",
    "   - User-item interaction matrices in real-world datasets are highly sparse.\n",
    "   - With limited overlap in interactions, finding meaningful similarities between users is challenging, leading to poor recommendation quality.\n",
    "3. **Cold-Start Problem**:\n",
    "   - New or inactive users with little interaction history cannot be effectively recommended items.\n",
    "   - Similarly, new items with no ratings cannot be suggested.\n",
    "4. **No Generalization**:\n",
    "   - The method does not learn latent patterns or adapt to new data. It only relies on explicit interactions, making it less robust in sparse or noisy datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to Modern Approaches\n",
    "Modern approaches, such as **matrix factorization** and **deep learning**, address these issues by:\n",
    "- Learning latent user and item features.\n",
    "- Capturing relationships beyond direct user-user similarities.\n",
    "- Generalizing better to sparse and cold-start scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, memory-based CF is conceptually important and serves as a foundation for understanding recommendation systems. It is often used as a baseline or for small-scale systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts Behind User-Based CF\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Core Idea**:\n",
    "- Users with similar preferences (e.g., rating patterns) are likely to enjoy the same items.\n",
    "- For a target user, the system identifies other users with similar interactions and recommends items they have liked but the target user has not yet interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Steps in User-Based CF**:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Build the User-Item Interaction Matrix\n",
    "- Create a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent items, and values represent interactions (e.g., ratings).\n",
    "- This matrix is usually sparse, as most users interact with only a small subset of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Compute User Similarity\n",
    "- Calculate the similarity between all pairs of users based on their interaction patterns.\n",
    "- Common similarity measures include:\n",
    "  - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two user vectors.\n",
    "  - **Pearson Correlation**: Measures the linear correlation between two user vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Find Similar Users\n",
    "- For a target user, identify the most similar users (neighbors).\n",
    "- Similar users are those with the highest similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Generate Recommendations\n",
    "- Aggregate the preferences of similar users to recommend items to the target user.\n",
    "- Common aggregation methods:\n",
    "  - Weighted average of ratings from similar users.\n",
    "  - Top-N items interacted with by similar users but not by the target user.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Evaluate the Model\n",
    "- Compare the recommendations to the ground truth from the test set.\n",
    "- Metrics to evaluate:\n",
    "  - **Precision@K**: Proportion of recommended items in the top-K that are relevant.\n",
    "  - **Recall@K**: Proportion of relevant items that are recommended in the top-K.\n",
