## Introduction

Planning is an important topic in AI because intelligent agents are expected to automatically plan their own actions in uncertain domains. Planning and scheduling systems are commonly used in automation and logistics operations, robotics and self-driving cars, and for aerospace applications like the Hubble telescope and NASA Mars rovers.

This project combines symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Additionally, it includes experimenting with different search algorithms and heuristics to analyze and understand the design of planning systems.
