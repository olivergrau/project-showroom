## Local Search Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This project explores local search algorithms by applying them to the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting point. In this exercise, the algorithms are tested on a problem involving several dozen US state capitals. 

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of local search techniques, such as simulated annealing, in solving complex optimization problems like the TSP, which is known for its computational challenges and practical applications in logistics and planning.
