      "        === START MOVIE PLOT SUMMARY FOR Event Horizon ===\n",
      "        Overview:\n",
      "Event Horizon is a 1997 science fiction horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner. It stars Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson. Set in 2047, it follows a crew of astronauts sent on a rescue mission after a missing spaceship, the Event Horizon, spontaneously appears in orbit around Neptune, only to discover that a sinister force has come back with it.\n",
      "The film had a troubled production, with filming and editing rushed by Paramount when it became clear that Titanic would not meet its projected release. The original 130-minute cut of the film was heavily edited by the studio's demand, to Anderson's consternation.\n",
      "On release, the film was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $42 million on a $60 million production budget. However, it began to sell well on home video; its initial DVD release sold so well that Paramount contacted Anderson to begin working on a restoration of the deleted footage, but it had been either lost or destroyed. In the years since, the film has developed a cult following and is referenced in other works of popular culture.\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "In 2047, a distress signal is received from the Event Horizon, a starship that disappeared during its maiden voyage to Proxima Centauri seven years earlier. The ship mysteriously reappears in orbit around Neptune, and the rescue vessel Lewis and Clark is dispatched to investigate. Its crew—Captain Miller, second-in-command Lieutenant Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, doctor D.J., and rescue technician Cooper—is joined by Dr. William Weir, the Event Horizon's designer. He briefs them on the ship's experimental gravity drive with a simple visualization of how it folds space-time. The distress signal consists of a series of screams and howls, but D.J. believes he hears the Latin phrase \"Liberate me\" (\"Save me\").\n",
      "Upon boarding the Event Horizon, the crew finds evidence of a massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive activates and briefly pulls Justin into a portal while also causing a shock wave that damages the Lewis and Clark. The crew are forced to board the Event Horizon while Justin emerges in a catatonic state. Smith and Cooper are sent on a spacewalk to repair the hull of the Lewis and Clark.\n",
      "The crew begins experiencing hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets. Miller sees a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death; Peters sees her son with his legs covered in bloody lesions; Weir sees an eyeless vision of his late wife urging him to join her. Justin attempts suicide by decompression, but he is saved by Miller. The crew places Justin in stasis. They discover a video log of the Event Horizon's crew brutalizing each other shortly after first engaging the gravity drive. The log ends with a shot of the Event Horizon's captain, holding his own eyes gouged from their sockets and speaking the Latin phrase from the earlier distress call. D.J. translates the complete phrase as \"Libera te tutemet ex inferis\" (\"Save yourself from hell\").\n",
      "Weir explains that the ship's drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension outside the known universe (implied to be Hell), and that the Event Horizon has attained sentience. Miller decides to destroy it. He orders an evacuation while Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged out his own eyes and is possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the Lewis and Clark which kills Smith and blasts Cooper into space. Weir kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown to activate the gravity drive and return to the other dimension.\n",
      "Cooper uses his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship and appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him, shattering the window, causing Weir to be blown into space by the decompression. Miller, Starck and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the Event Horizon in two with explosives and use its forward section as a lifeboat. He is attacked by hallucinations which turn out to be the resurrected and further mutilated Weir. Miller fights him off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.\n",
      "The gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin and wait to be rescued. Seventy-two days later, the wreckage of the Event Horizon is boarded by a rescue party who discover the survivors in stasis. Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers and screams in terror, but she awakens and realizes that it was a nightmare. Cooper and the rescue team try to calm the terrified Starck as the doors close.\n",

      "        Overview:\n",
      "Infinity Pool is a 2023 science fiction horror film written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, and starring Alexander Skarsgård, Mia Goth, and Cleopatra Coleman. The film follows a struggling writer and his wife on vacation who, after an accident, discover the country's dark culture.\n",
      "Cronenberg started developing the project in 2019, with production later being pushed back to 2021. Much of the cast joined the project that year and filming took place primarily in Šibenik, Croatia.\n",
      "Infinity Pool premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2023. It was released theatrically in Canada by Elevation Pictures on January 27, 2023. The film received positive reviews from critics.\n",
      "Plot:\n",
      "Novelist James Foster and his wife Em spend time at a resort in the fictional seaside country of Li Tolqa, where a local festival is underway. The couple's chronic marital strife is exacerbated when Gabi, a fan of the only novel James has published, invites them to spend time with her and her husband Alban. The four have dinner and spend the next day driving in the countryside, even though they have been warned that tourists are to remain on the resort grounds at all times.\n",
      "At a beach, as James urinates behind a tree, Gabi unexpectedly grabs him from behind and gives him a handjob, which he enjoys. After a long day of sunbathing and cooking, the tourists drunkenly drive back to their hotel. En route, James accidentally hits a local man, killing him. Gabi insists that they cannot call the police as the country is corrupt and they will not be safe.\n",
      "The next day, James is arrested and told that the penalty for his crime is death at the hand of his victim's firstborn son. However, the country has a unique system of justice reserved for foreign nationals due to diplomatic agreement, whereby the guilty, for a hefty fee, can be cloned and have their duplicates killed in their place. James, who married into money, pays the fee to escape execution.  However, as part of the deal, he must watch the execution of his clone. While Em is horrified by the entire affair and wants to leave immediately, James is titillated by the spectacle and doesn't share her urgency. He discovers that his passport is missing but encourages Em to return to the United States.\n",
      "James extends his stay by a week and encounters Gabi and Alban again. They introduce him to a small group of Western tourists who all have been convicted of serious crimes and have paid to watch their doubles killed. These people return to the resort annually, commit heinous crimes, and pay to watch their doubles get slaughtered. Over the next several days, they encourage James to transform into a libertine criminal, encouraging him to kill locals, engage in intoxicated orgies (as he uses a local hallucinogen with Gabi, it's unclear how much of the orgy is real), and abuse other resort guests.\n",
      "One night James is tricked into brutalizing a clone of himself he had been led to believe was the detective who initially arrested him. In a moment of clarity and panic, James retrieves the passport he had hidden in order to stay in Li Tolqa and attempts to flee. However, the tourist group abducts him from the bus transporting him to the airport. Gabi reveals that she finds him pathetic, that she never read his book, and that he was targeted by the group, which is abusing him for their own amusement. The accident James and Em had with Gabi and Alban made their plan easier to implement. James runs off into a nearby wilderness, but Gabi shoots him in the leg.\n",
      "After hours of wandering, James collapses at a farm, where a local family takes him in to recuperate. In his drugged state, he experiences another series of hallucinations. Once he has regained his strength, he is again confronted by Gabi's group, who order him to kill a leashed duplicate of himself they refer to as \"the dog\" to complete his transformation into a murdering tourist. He initially refuses, but when the clone attempts to kill him, James beats him to death. Gabi consoles James by exposing her bare breast, covering it with the warm blood of \"the dog\" and inviting him to simulate breastfeeding.\n",
      "The next day, as they head back to the United States, the other tourists casually chat about upcoming errands, while James is visibly traumatized. Waiting in the airport for his flight, he resolves to remain behind instead. He returns to the closed resort, where he sits alone amidst the downpour of the monsoon.\n",
