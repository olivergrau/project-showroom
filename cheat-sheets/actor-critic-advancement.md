# Why Actor-Critic is an Advancement Over Policy Gradient Methods

## **1. Reduces High Variance in Policy Gradient Methods**
### **Issue with Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)**
- The policy gradient theorem uses Monte Carlo estimates of rewards, leading to **high variance**.
- The vanilla REINFORCE algorithm updates policy parameters based on sampled returns:

  \[
  \nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} G_t \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t \mid s_t) \right]
  \]

  where \( G_t \) is the total discounted return from time \( t \).

- Since this uses **full trajectory rewards**, updates are **noisy**, making training unstable.

### **How Actor-Critic Fixes This**
- Instead of using **full episode returns**, the **Critic** provides an estimate of the value function \( V(s) \).
- The **Advantage Function** replaces total returns \( G_t \) with a lower-variance estimate:

  \[
  A(s_t, a_t) = r_t + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t)
  \]

  This significantly **reduces variance** while still keeping the policy updates unbiased.

## **2. Improves Sample Efficiency**
### **Issue with Policy Gradient Methods**
- Vanilla policy gradient methods use only **final rewards** after an entire episode, meaning:
  - Long episodes delay learning.
  - Wasted interactions since updates happen only at the end of episodes.

### **How Actor-Critic Fixes This**
- **Bootstrapping**: The Critic updates its estimate \( V(s) \) **at every step**, enabling **faster learning**.
- Uses **TD-learning** instead of Monte Carlo estimates:

  \[
  \delta_t = r_t + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t)
  \]

  This allows learning from **incomplete trajectories**, reducing sample complexity.

## **3. Enables Off-Policy Learning**
### **Issue with Policy Gradient Methods**
- REINFORCE requires on-policy updates (i.e., training only with samples from the current policy).
- This means **every policy update discards previous experiences**, leading to inefficient learning.

### **How Actor-Critic Fixes This**
- Some Actor-Critic variants (e.g., **DDPG, TD3**) use **experience replay**.
- The **Critic** can learn from past experiences, making the method **more sample efficient**.

---

## **4. More Stable Updates**
### **Issue with Policy Gradient Methods**
- Policy gradient updates fluctuate a lot because they rely solely on raw rewards.
- High-variance updates make training **unstable**.

### **How Actor-Critic Fixes This**
- The **Critic** smooths policy updates by providing a **stable baseline**.
- Instead of using **raw rewards**, the policy gradient now uses a smoothed function \( V(s) \).
- More stable training leads to **better convergence**.

## **5. Basis for More Advanced Methods**
Actor-Critic is not just an improvement‚Äîit serves as a **foundation** for many state-of-the-art RL algorithms:

- **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)**: Parallelizes Actor-Critic updates to improve efficiency.
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Adds clipping to prevent overly large updates.
- **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**: Extends AC to **continuous action spaces**.
- **TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**: Reduces overestimation bias in DDPG.

## **Conclusion: Why Actor-Critic is Better**

| **Variance Reduction**     | ‚ùå High variance (Monte Carlo) | ‚úÖ Lower variance with Critic |
| **Sample Efficiency**      | ‚ùå Requires many episodes | ‚úÖ Learns from single steps |
| **Learning Stability**     | ‚ùå Noisy, unstable updates | ‚úÖ More stable updates |
| **On-policy Only?**        | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (but off-policy possible in some variants) |
